The Initiative Tracker plugin for **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** allows you to keep track of initiative and turn order during combat encounters in tabletop role-playing games.

With this plugin, you can add creatures and NPCs to the initiative tracker, and track their health, armor class, and other stats. The plugin also calculates experience points for creatures, and supports both custom and SRD creatures from the **[Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks)** plugin.

## Features
- Add and remove creatures from the encounter
- Input creature name, HP, AC and initiative
- Calculate creature XP based on level or challenge rating
- Group identical creatures together to simplify the encounter
- Set creature display names to differentiate identical creatures
- Supports dice rolls to add random amount creatures
- Keep track of creature HP, AC and status
- Sort creatures by initiative automatically
- Add several encounters in one code block
- Automatically save and load encounters
- And much, much more...

### Quickstart

- Install the Initiative Tracker plugin in Obsidian.
- Open a note where you want to keep track of your encounter.
- Create a code block with the language set to \`\`\`encounter.

````yaml
```encounter
name: Example
creatures:
 - 3: Goblin
```
````

- Add creatures to the encounter by name, dice roll or bestiary entry.
- Launch the encounter by clicking on the play button, and start tracking initiative.

Check out the **[plugin documentation](https://plugins.javalent.com/it)** for more detailed instructions and examples.
